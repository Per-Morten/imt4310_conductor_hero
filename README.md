* In order to launch the game, execute the .exe file in the downloaded "imt4310_conductor_hero/conductor_hero/Binaries/Windows/" folder. 

## Playing the game
### Before starting
* Once the executeable has been run, the stage will start in in a unlit state. 
* It is necessary to identify which controller is the left and right once before continuing. The left controller has a laser pointer while the right does not.
* The player should then stand at the center of the stage and be ready to start calibrating the height of the motion tracking spheres. 
* Holding the menu button on the right controller allows to change the height of the motion tracking spheres.
  * The spheres should be placed at a comfortable height so the top sphere can be easily hit. 
* Once the menu button is released, the game starts by preparing a countdown to the start of the song which ends with the first cue. 

### While playing
* The right controller is used for conducting the visually displayed pattern by hitting the spheres on beat. 
* The left controller is used to hit cues whenever they are ready.  
  * It is intended to hit a cue at the start of a measure so once the circular progress starts, the first beat of the next measure is the one that the player should aim for. 
    * The first beat of a measure is always the bottom sphere.
